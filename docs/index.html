                📬 DEAR HUMAN OF HUMANITY,</p>

            <div class="h5 letter courier">
<p class="pre-wrap">Here's the deal.

We have to fix everything in one go, worldwide.

And we have to make it amazing.

Amazing or bust.

That's the only way to fix any of our issues permanently.

All humans amazing.

Only by working on everything together and focusing strictly on amazing can we get ourselves out of the mess we are in.

No issue left behind.

No human left behind.

No nation left behind.

Everyone amazing.

If you are interested in creating an amazing world for all, join me at The Amazing Show.

Coming soon to each of the 56 US states and territories, then worldwide.

We'll sing and dance together at every show and you'll start to see for yourself that you always had it in you to be an amazing singer and dancer.

Becoming an amazing singer and dancer is a thought process.

You'll think your way to singing and dancing amazingly.

It would be helpful to me if you looked over this show page and shared it with family and friends.

And hopefully we can get this show on the road by April 2023 at the latest. Hopefully sooner, maybe in December of 2022.

I'm thinking we do this in big <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_contemporary_amphitheatres" target="_blank">outdoor ampitheaters</a>.

Every show will be free as this show will be run as a public service for humanity. Maybe one day you'll be on the show. Maybe one day you'll host it.

The show dates are yet to be set, so for now the way to keep up with dates is to follow one of the media accounts listed below. Or you can search for <b>VeryAmazingShow</b> on your favorite platform.

In the meantime, you can also look over the <a href="http://whomanatee.org" target="_blank">parent company</a> to read details on how we can logistically make the world amazing.

But before we get to that plan, we'll first need to have some public conversations to get us thinking amazing.

And that's what this show is all about.

It's called The Amazing Show because we're focused on making the world amazing, not so much that it'll be an amazing show.

I do hope that it will be an amazing show from day one.

I'll be talking, clapping, singing, and dancing at every show.

And hopefully you reading this will be there and be doing the same from the comfort of your seat at the show or a seat at home.

We'll stream the shows to various online platforms for free and public consumption.

I hope we all one day get to see both an amazing world and an amazing peoples emerge before us.

And I hope to see you soon at a show.

sincerely,
a fellow human of humanity
